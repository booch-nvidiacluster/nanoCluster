# nanoCluster
An simple compute platform.

<img src="/Documentation/Images/cluster 1.jpg">

This is a simple cluster, composed of four NVIDIA Jetson Nano single board computers (which provide the cluster's essential computational resources) together with a touch screen LCD (which serves as the cluster's monitoring and control console). While the nanoCluster is a general-purpose compute platform suitable for many use cases, it was created primarly as an experimental platform for the development of <a href="https://github.com/booch-self">Self</a>, a hybrid neuro/symbolic architecture for AGI. Further extending the nanoCluster is the <a href="https://github.com/booch-nvidiacluster/xavierEdge">xavierEdge</a>, an embodied node provisioned with various sensors and actuators.

The physical components of the nanoCluster are enumerated in its <a href="/Documentation/Bill%20of%20Materials.md">Bill of Materials</a>; the details of the cluster's physical assembly are described in <a href="/Documentation/Hardware.md">Hardware</a>. Documentation for the setup and provisioning of each Nano is found in <a href="/Documentation/Software.md">Software</a>.
