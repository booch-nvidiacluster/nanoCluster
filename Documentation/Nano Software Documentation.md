Here are instructions for provisioning each Nano in the cluster with a basic stack - Ubuntu, Python, Apache, and MySQL - plus various tools and libraries for general development, frameworks for AI, and an infrastructure for hosting microservices.

Several bits of code, needed in support of this provisioning, reside <a href="../nano">here</a>.

 ## Ubuntu
 
 1.	Download the Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image to a host computer from https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack.
 
 2.	Write the image from the host computer to the memory card using https://www.balena.io/etcher/.
 
 3. Install the memory card in the Nano.
 
 4. Attach the Nano to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, boot it, then follow the start up instructions to configure the user account and wireless connection (see also https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#setup-first-boot).
 
 5. 
 
 ```
 sudo git clone https://github.com/jetsonHacksNano/rootOnUSB
 ```
