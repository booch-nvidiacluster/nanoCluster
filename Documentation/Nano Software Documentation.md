# Nano Software Documentation
The cluster's essential computational resources.

The console serves two use cases: to display the state of each node in the cluster and to permit the user to power off individual nodes. The console's display is divided into several rows, each of which represents a single node. During the lifecycle of a node, its state is displayed here. Once a node is logged in, the node's name is displayed along with its IP address. Below these labels are two bars, the gray one representing the node's CPU utilization and the blue one representing the node's primary memory utilization. To the right of these labels is a power icon which can be touched to power off a node. In the center of each power icon is a blinking dot, mirroring the node's heartbeat.
